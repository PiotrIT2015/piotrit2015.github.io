      I am hungry for learning, self improvement and always have a willingness to accept constructive criticism, able to
      work as a self guided team member. I enjoy creating great products with great user experiences and working in a dynamic environment with a focus on good development practices, automation and shipping small, frequent releases.
      In free time I develop petester skills.
